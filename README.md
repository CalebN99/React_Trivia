# React_Trivia

React Trivia was my final project for my web development boot camp. We had to pick a new web technology from a list and I picked React, and create a neat project with it. So I made a full stack computer science trivia game. MERN stack, Mongo, Express, React, Node. 

To run app. In the first directory in the terminal enter  |  npm run dev  |.  It will run the front end and the back end.
