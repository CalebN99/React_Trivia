# React_Trivia

First react-application. Final project for my web development bootcamp back in 2019. It is a trivia game, where a player can select a category and a difficulty, then get points based on how fast they answer each question. Player scores are shown in a public score board. This project is built using the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express, React, Node).

To run app. In the first directory in the terminal enter  |  npm run dev  |.  It will run the front end and the back end.
